# 🩸 Decentralized Blood & Organ Donation Registry

## 📌 What is this project?

This project is a **blockchain-based registry** that enables donors and hospitals to **securely register blood and organ availability**. The smart contract transparently matches recipients with compatible donors, ensuring **fairness, trust, and traceability** in the donation process.

The registry eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces the risk of black-market exploitation, and creates an **immutable record of donations** that hospitals, patients, and regulators can verify.

## 🧠 Why build this project?
 
The healthcare sector faces serious challenges when it comes to organ and blood donation systems:

1. **Black Market & Exploitation**

   - Organ trafficking and exploitation of vulnerable individuals are global issues.
   - A decentralized registry ensures all transactions and matches are transparent and tamper-proof.

2. **Lack of Trust & Transparency**

   - Patients and families often worry about favoritism, corruption, or unfair allocation.
   - With smart contracts, the **matching logic is automated** and visible to everyone.

3. **Traceability & Verification**

   - Currently, it’s hard to verify whether an organ/blood unit is genuine or tampered with.
   - Blockchain provides **auditability**, making the entire journey traceable.

4. **Efficiency in Emergencies**
   - In urgent cases, every second matters.
   - Automated donor–recipient matching reduces manual paperwork and delays.

## 🌍 Why it matters

This project represents **Blockchain for Good** in the healthcare sector.  
By combining **decentralization, transparency, and automation**, it builds a system that could:

- Save lives faster
- Prevent corruption and exploitation
- Increase trust between patients, donors, and hospitals

## ⚙️ How it works

- **Donors** register their availability with blood type and organ type.
- **Recipients** register their needs with required blood type and organ.
- **Hospitals (or authorized entities)** call the smart contract function to match donors with recipients.
- **Matching Logic:**
  - Same blood type
  - Same organ type
  - Donor available & recipient not yet matched

Every registration and match is logged on-chain using events, making the process **transparent, auditable, and immutable**.

## 🔑 Core Features

- ✅ **On-Chain Registry** for donors and recipients.
- ✅ **Transparent Matching Algorithm** (blood type + organ type).
- ✅ **Tamper-Proof Records** to prevent manipulation.
- ✅ **Events for Traceability** (DonorRegistered, RecipientRegistered, MatchFound).
- ✅ **Fair & Trustless Allocation** without relying on centralized authorities.
